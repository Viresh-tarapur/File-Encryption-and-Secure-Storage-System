#🔒 How It Works

User signs up and logs in.

When a file is uploaded:

The file is encrypted using a secure encryption algorithm.

The encrypted file is stored in the database.

When the authorized user downloads the file:

The system decrypts it.

The original file is returned securely.

Only the file owner can access or manage their files.
