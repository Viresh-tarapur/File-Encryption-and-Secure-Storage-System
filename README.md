## In this project i used MVC Architecture 

![MVC architecture,](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b09969dd-fbfe-4c9c-ab71-291aa82c763c)

🧩 MVC Architecture – Project Design

SecureVault is built using the MVC (Model – View – Controller) architecture to ensure clean code structure, scalability, and strong security practices.

🗄️ Model – Data & Security Layer

Manages MySQL database operations

Stores user credentials & encrypted files

Performs encryption / decryption logic

Ensures data confidentiality and integrity

🎨 View – User Interface Layer

Built with HTML + Bootstrap (Dark UI)

Displays Signup, Login, Dashboard & File Cards

Dynamically renders user data

Provides a modern and responsive experience

⚙️ Controller – Application Logic Layer

Implemented using Flask Routes

Handles user requests & responses

Connects Model ↔ View

Performs authentication & password validation

Controls secure operations like upload, view, download, delete

🔄 Request Flow
User → Controller → Model → Database → Controller → View → User

✨ Why MVC?

Better Code Organization

Easy Maintenance & Scaling

Improved Security Handling

Separation of Concerns

Professional Software Design

This architecture ensures that SecureVault is not just a working app, but a well-structured and industry-style secure system. 🔐🚀
